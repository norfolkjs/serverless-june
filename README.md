When you combine a Lighning Talk on Serverless, an Alexa Skill promotion from Amazon, and the 757Dev community (with so much rain _no one_ wants to go outside) you've got all the makings of an epic rush of new Serverless devs and projects—Serverless June is born!

We're cataloging this awesome effort and will soon link up all of the projects and code developed by our community of developers, artists, and tinkerers.

### How can I take part?
Did NorfolkJS inspire you to build something new in the Serverless world? Did our resident Code-Ninja Cats spark your new Alexa skill? Did you get the idea in June? Send us a message with your repo and a link to the endpoint or skill and we'll throw it up.

### Where did you get those classy badges?
[Shields.io](https://shields.io) lets you create custom, pixel-perfect badges. If you want to show off your NorfolkJS or Serverless Pride simply add ours to your markdown.
